# Synchronization_btw_keyboard-oscillations

These codes perform the analyses for the paper:
Duprez. J., Stokkermans. M., Drijvers. L., Cohen. M.X. "Synchronization between keyboard typing and neural oscillations"

Overall behavioral and eeg analyses were performed using matlab, plotting was done in python, and statistical analyses on R.
An example of the structure used for analyses is provided here as well as an eeglab data template containing electrode locations.
Codes are written to work on eeglab data structures.

All codes were tested and perform accurate computations. However, there's definitely room for improvement in the coding. 
For instance, several processes can be optimized by vectorizing and bypassing loops.
